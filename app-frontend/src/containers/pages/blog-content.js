      ` Artificial intelligence is founded on the idea that human intelligence can be described in a way that makes it simple for a computer to imitate it and carry out tasks of all sizes, from the simplest to the most difficult. Artificial intelligence aims to emulate cognitive processes in humans. When it comes to concretely defining processes like learning, reasoning, and perception, researchers and developers in the field are making unexpectedly quick progress. Some people think that soon inventors might be able to create systems that are better than what humans are currently capable of learning or understanding. Others, however, continue to hold this view because all cognitive processes involve value judgments that are influenced by human experience.

    The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed.
