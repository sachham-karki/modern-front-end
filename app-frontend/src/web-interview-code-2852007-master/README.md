# Mastering Web Developer Interview Code

This is the repository for my course Mastering Web Developer Interview Code. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mastering-web-developer-interview-code-2).

Whether you're actively looking for a new job, or you just want to keep your coding skills sharp, it's important to refresh your understanding of the kinds of front-end and full-stack developer code that potential employers value. In this weekly series, senior staff author explores essential coding skills that every developer should have in their toolkit. In addition to taking you through a series of brief, practical exercises, this course includes interviews with hiring managers and industry professionals that can help demystify the interview process for web developers, and provide you with examples of how others in the field have navigated their careers. Tune in every Tuesday for a new tip.

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.

## Branches

The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspod to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.

## Documentation

If there are slides for this course, they will be available using the `gh-pages` branch. You can easily get to the slides by going to http://raybo.org/masteringcode. The slides were created using [rayveal.js](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/rayveal) an opinionated version of the excellent reveal.js framework. Within these slides you can also read my notes for the project, just hit `ctrl-m` to get a menu with all of the slides for the project.
